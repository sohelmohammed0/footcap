Not only this div every div must be in centre of the screen (like square in rectangle) and not overwhelmed divs i want perfect divs and almost at the footer i want a place holder so that the user must be able to enter the order id and can check order status, add admin panel so that the admin of website can login as admin and can check no of products sold, left and complete data of products ans in edit profile section i dont want order history now provide me updated index.html only then i will ask for css and js then you can provide css and js. Ensure you dont make any changes except the above also dont disturb the UI
